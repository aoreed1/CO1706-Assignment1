      <h2>Clear and easy to read</h2>

      <p>My main ethos with designing the layout for this web application is I wanted to make everything big and easy to read. Friedman (2008) says a good website shouldn't make users think, and I wanted to make sure my website conformed to that. The text in general is large and clear. The initial titles, in particular, are very big and easy to read. The use of black text on white backgrounds and white text on grey backgrounds ensures legibility for every user, including those with sight impairments. The navigation is large, clear and prominent at the top of the page, ensuring the user can easily navigate around the site.</p>

      <h2>Focussing the user's attention</h2>

      <p>Friedman (2008) also discussed how a correctly designed website should focus the user's attention to the right places. I implemented this in my website using colours and outlined boxes. For example, on the home page, the Family plan is the most expensive option and so that is the one that the client will want to sell the most of. I therefore added a banner above the Family plan box with the text "Amazing value!" and I made the banner a bright colour. This draws the user's attention to that part of the screen and then they are more likely to want to choose the Family plan.</p>

      <h2>Responsive layout</h2>

      <p>Websites are not just viewed on computers anymore. People now use a range of devices with different screen sizes and ratios to browse the web. In fact, nearly half of all web traffic now comes from mobile devices (Oberlo, 2020). I therefore wanted to ensure that this website looks good and works well on whatever device it is viewed on. I used viewport (vw) relative sizing for all elements on the site and this has created a responsive design which adapts to the size of the viewing window. I also used a @media query with a max-width property in order to set specific styling for mobile devices. For example, on the Music page, the genre buttons are displayed in rows of four on a large screen but on a mobile device they are displayed in rows of two. This all ensures that the user has a good experience from whatever device that access it on.</p>
